xlg serves as a primary place to host the component i design and a place where i can reference/utilize in my future job.

Spring Framework has been my favourite framework to start off any project/application i'm working on. It is open source and there are many goodies residing in the code to learn from. All the component depict here is tie to Spring Framework and will work out of the box. However, with some tweak it should be able to be incorporate into your project. Source code are provided so feel free to hack it.
